# Traffic Sign Recognition Using CNN

This project implements a Traffic Sign Recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in Python with TensorFlow and OpenCV. The model classifies images of traffic signs into multiple categories based on their class labels.

## Features:
- Real-time traffic sign recognition using a webcam feed.
- Preprocessing of images to enhance contrast and normalize pixel values.
- Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify traffic sign images.
- Data augmentation to improve model performance and generalization.

## Setup and Requirements:
1. Clone this repository:
